## Phylogenies

The nearest neighbours of each of the query sequences are shown below in order to show their phylogenetic context.

They are coloured by the input field specified. 
If no fields were specified, they are coloured by Adm1. 

If there was no geographical information provided (either adm1 or adm2), the sequences are left uncoloured. 
In order to generate trees coloured by specific metadata, please provide this names of the appropriate metadata columns on the command line.









The legend for adm1 is shown below.

Tree number 1 contains 3 queries.
There are multiple query sequences in this tree, and so transmission cannot be ruled out, but neither can it be confirmed. Therefore their relationship must be investigated further using epidemiological data.
   
![](./figures/civet_report_make_trees_1.png)
Tree number 2 contains 36 queries.
There are multiple query sequences in this tree, and so transmission cannot be ruled out, but neither can it be confirmed. Therefore their relationship must be investigated further using epidemiological data.
   
![](./figures/civet_report_make_trees_2.png)
Tree number 3 contains 61 queries.
There are multiple query sequences in this tree, and so transmission cannot be ruled out, but neither can it be confirmed. Therefore their relationship must be investigated further using epidemiological data.
   
![](./figures/civet_report_make_trees_3.png)
Tree number 4 contains 1 query.
Given that there are no other sequences in the query dataset that are in this tree, transmission between this sequence and other queries can be ruled out.
   
![](./figures/civet_report_make_trees_4.png)
Tree number 5 contains 3 queries.
There are multiple query sequences in this tree, and so transmission cannot be ruled out, but neither can it be confirmed. Therefore their relationship must be investigated further using epidemiological data.

Tree number 6 contains 1 query.
Given that there are no other sequences in the query dataset that are in this tree, transmission between this sequence and other queries can be ruled out.

## Tree background

The following plots describe the data in the collapsed nodes in more detail.
If more than one country was present, the bar chart describes the number of sequences present in each country. 
Where there were 10 countries or more, the largest 10 have been taken. 
If a UK sequence is present in the collapsed node, it is always shown in the plot.

## Appendix

This report summarises the information provided by whole genome sequencing of SARS-COV-2 generated by the COG consortium. 
It is intended to provide an additional layer of analysis for infection control efforts, and to aid in the investigation of outbreak clusters.

For each query sequence, CIVET either finds them in the COG database, or matches them as closely as possible to a sequence in the COG database, and puts them into a UK lineage.

Key points for interpreting this information:

 - This type of analysis is not able to infer direct transmission between two samples. Even identical sequences may be unrelated as SARS-COV2 is relatively slow evolving for an RNA virus. Previous analysis has shown that samples taken over 100 days apart can be identical. 
 - If sequences have different global or UK lineage designations, we can rule out close epidemiological linkage.
 - If sequences have different phylotypes it’s very unlikely that they are direct transmissions. 
 - If sequences share the same lineage and the same phylotype, transmission cannot be ruled out and also cannot be confirmed.


The figure below shows the distribution of time differences that two sequences can be sampled and still be identical. 
It is to illustrate that identical sequences does not confirm linked cases.

### Useful definitions

*Phylotype* 

Each lineage phylogeny is labelled with phylotypes that describe shared mutations in the tree. If two sequences have the same phylotype it means the share mutations. They may also have additional, unique mutations. So having the same phylotype doesn't mean the seqeunces are identical. If sequences have different phylotypes however it means they are present on distinct parts of the phylogenetic tree.

*UK lineage* 

UK lineages are an approximation to distinct introductions of SARS-CoV-2 to the UK based on the phylogenetic tree.

*Global lineage* 

Assigned using the pangolin software, these are phylogenetic lineages. More information can be found at https://github.com/hCoV-2019/lineages
