I am a Tenure Track Fellow in Health at the University of Liverpool, UK, working in the 
[Signal Processing Group](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/electrical-engineering-and-electronics/research/data-science-signal-processing/signalprocessing/) 
of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics.
I am interested in designing Bayesian scalable models for the evolution of genomes and diseases, with special interest in microbes of potential clinical interest.
I used to be the Head of Phylogenomics at the [Quadram Institute Bioscience](https://quadram.ac.uk/) (QIB) in Norwich, UK, where I
developed, implemented, and streamlined computational methods for the evolutionary analysis of microbial data sets.

Previously I was a postdoctoral researcher working on Evolutionary Genomics at the [Dessimoz Group](http://lab.dessimoz.org) in the University of Lausanne, 
where I was also affiliated to the [SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics](https://www.isb-sib.ch). 
I have also postdoctoral experience working with Hyperspectral Data Analysis at the [Stevens Group of Imperial College London](http://www.stevensgroup.org), 
and with Phylogenomics at [David Posada's Lab](https://dposada.webs.uvigo.es/) of the University of Vigo. 
I did my Ph.D. on Bayesian Phylogenetics at the [Laboratory of Biometry and Bioinformatics](http://www.ab.a.u-tokyo.ac.jp/aeb/laboratory/bb_e.html) of the University of Tokyo, 
under the supervision of [Prof. Hirohisa Kishino](http://lbm.ab.a.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~kishino/).

Since we still struggle with international names: my first name is **Leonardo** and my surname/family name is **de Oliveira Martins**. I don't have a middle name.
