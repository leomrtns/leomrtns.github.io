I am the Head of Phylogenomics at the [Quadram Institute Bioscience](https://quadram.ac.uk/) (QIB) in Norwich, UK. 
There, I develop, implement, and streamline computational methods for the evolutionary analysis of microbial data sets.


Previously I was a postdoctoral researcher working on Evolutionary Genomics at the [Dessimoz Group](http://lab.dessimoz.org) in the University of Lausanne, 
where I was also affiliated to the [SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics](https://www.isb-sib.ch). 
I have also postdoctoral experience working with Hyperspectral Data Analysis at the [Stevens Group of Imperial College London](http://www.stevensgroup.org), 
and with Evolutionary Biology at [David Posada's Phylogenomics Lab] of the University of Vigo. 
I did my Ph.D. on Bayesian Phylogenetics at the [Laboratory of Biometry and Bioinformatics](https://sites.google.com/a/ut-biomet.org/lbm/home) of the University of Tokyo, 
under the supervision of Prof. Hirohisa Kishino.
