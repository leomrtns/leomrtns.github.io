The episode of [Feynman vs. The Abacus](https://www.ee.ryerson.ca/~elf/abacus/feynman.html) shows that you can go along
way even without a deep understanding of the problem you are solving.
In this story from when Feynman visited Brazil, he competes with an abacus salesman who is very quick with simple artihmetics, 
but slower than Feynman with more complex operations like cubic root.
Feynman then realises that the salesman doesn't have a good grasp of mathematics or interest in approximation approaches, he
only knows how to move the beads mechanically.

if you are from the filed, you know the implications of misusing a word. However if you are not actually familiar with
the term, you can change its meaning without feeling the consequences. E.g. "clade" in sars-cov-2: you don't care that
saying clade B is not clade A will make it harder for students to grasp the term. 

btw you don't need to be from the field to car about the proper terms. In fact that is the reason why we have to respect
definitions: I don't need to be a graph theorist to know that a De Bruijn graph has edges between all neighbours, but if
I ever need to learn about it (to e.g. [find the most compact representation of all n-strings in an
alphabet a.k.a. a superstring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_sequence)) or if I am reading a specialised article,
it will be much easier.
On the other hand if read an article that assumes a non-standard, conflicting definition it may be more difficult to learn from it (doing
the opposite of what an article should be about)

As a curiosity, when I [asked about it on a forum](https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/questions/146/how-to-make-a-distinction-between-the-classical-de-bruijn-graph-and-the-one-de)
people were up in arms against my ignorance, at the same time that they had to use a term to tell them apart (as I was
asking?)
BTW the tacit answer was "assembly DBG", as [commented later](https://lh3.github.io/2017/11/15/on-assembly-de-bruijn-graphs).
Maybe this is due to a lack of formal training in Computer Science, where they cannot take apart a data structure
(abstract concept) from its implementation?
