# Evolutionary paths are not the shortest ones
One source of confusion is between parsimony and compatibility. Compatibility is the assumption that there is a tree
that explains perfectly the genomic divergence, or alternatively that given the sequences, there is one single possible
tree, since all splits of the data are **compatible** with that tree. The parsimony method in phylogenetics does not find such a tree, it 
finds however the tree (it can be more than one, but let's skip the discussion of terraces for now) where the number of
violations of parsimony is minimized. 

Phyletic patterns (i.e. presence/absence of genes) are not parsimonious, they need HGT, gain, and losses to be explained (https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-3-2).
Parsimony can be used as a tool since simpler models can have less overfitting, but they do not represent reality (https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.04228 , https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-5193(82)90274-0).
