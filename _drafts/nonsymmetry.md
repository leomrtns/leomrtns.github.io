## _Homo sum_ and the lack of symmetry in arguments

Many years ago, in Brazil, a politician used Terence's famous quotation "I am human, and nothing human is alien to me"
to justify his own malfeasance.
This is a quote about compassion, for since we are all humans we should not be too quick in judging others.
It seemed obvious to me that it does not work both ways: I can forgive you, but you can't use the same logic to forgive
yourself.
Modern life becomes lighter if we forego this symmetry: we can be strict to ourselves and kind to others.

## Shallow and deep understanding

We complain about poor peer reviews and low standard for publishing, but we are also responsible for these.
Some publishers and researchers are realising that we are not as careful when reading, citing, and
building upon published work.
As long as it's published we are rewarded (with citations, buzz, and publicity), and therefore there is more incentive
for publishing more (nobody will read it diligently) than better.
Shallow understanding is associated to this, by assuming that if you can recite the title and abstract of a paper, then
you can assume it to be true. 
Or that if you have your name in a paper about something, then you automatically becomes an expert on said subject.
I don't know if shallow thinking is a cause or a consequence of lazy publishing, but I have the impression that it became
more of an issue in recent times. 
So I'd risk saying younger researchers have more incentives to learn quickly and superficially about many subjects than
before, since they can always throw a few papers apparently supporting their argument. 
It is hard to challenge an argument in a paper, and unchallenged arguments become the truth. 
And the pressure for writing many papers with low informational content and overwhelming, grandiose claims, is not new. 

Pedestrian understanding.

## Reading a manuscript without prejudice

One problem with reviewers is that they seldomly read a manuscript without a preconceived view of what they expect to
find.

## Evolution of terms 

Even MLST (multi-locus sequence typing), that historically is an amplicon-based classification of a few housekeeping
genes, is slowly evolving into any multi-locus based classification. However cgMLST, wgMLST, and rMLST are all
whole-genome based (they are a side-effect of the sequencing, since they use only a fraction of the genomic
information, in contrast with the original MLST which was the main outcome of the sequencing). 

There is nothing intrinsically wrong with any of these new uses of the terms, but it's always good if we remember their
history. 
Because sometimes we may need to distinguish them (and maybe avoid reinventing the wheel?), it may help review a
manuscript with less prejudice, and it may point to a deeper understanding of the subject.

### Reinventing the wheel
Speaking of "reinventing the wheel", I [suggested recently](https://twitter.com/leomrtns/status/1487837758706040836)
that we are bad at identifying novelty if we are not very familiar with the subject.
And this is also a problem of asymmetry, since we are better at judging (and therefore avoiding) if we are
reinventing something obvious, than we are at passing judgement over other people's attempts.
Therefore if you feel tempted to disencourage someone since it seems to you to be something obvious, provide them
instead with references of what you think does the same, and suggest them to take a look, and compare.
