I am Leonardo de Oliveira Martins, a computational biologist specialised in Evolutionary Genomics. I am a senior
researcher at the [Quadram Institute Biosciences](http://wwww.quadram.ac.uk), where I develop, implement, and streamline 
computational methods for the evolutionary analysis of microbial data sets.
