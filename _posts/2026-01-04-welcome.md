I am [Leonardo de Oliveira Martins](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/people/leonardo-de-oliveira-martins), 
a Bayesian computational biologist specialised in Evolutionary Genomics. 
I am a Tenure Track Fellow at the 
[Signal Processing Group](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/electrical-engineering-and-electronics/research/data-science-signal-processing/signalprocessing/) 
of the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/).

I used to be a senior researcher at the [Quadram Institute Biosciences](http://wwww.quadram.ac.uk), where I 
developed, implemented, and streamlined hig-performing computational methods for the evolutionary analysis 
of microbial data sets.
